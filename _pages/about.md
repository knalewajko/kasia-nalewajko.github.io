I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the Collegio Carlo Alberto. Previously, I held a joint position of postdoctoral researcher at the Universidad Carlos III and Juan March Institute.

I research the dynamics and legacies of extreme forms of violence. Specifically, I am motivated to understand how the Holocaust started, how people tried to survive it, and how we remember it. I am a proponent of mixed-methods approaches. In my work, I use causal inference methods, standard statistical tools, and process tracing. Being a polyglot, I also love playing with computational tools. They help me acquire and clean data, e.g., web scrape, OCR archival collections or analyse large amounts of text. By using these methods alongside social science theories and deep case knowledge I seek to make cross-disciplinary contributions, not only to the political violence literature in political science, but also to the otherwise extremely rich History scholarship of the Holocaust. Additionally, I am interested in how our very fragmented field of political violence literature in political science could become more unified. Some of my research will soon appear in the *American Political Science Review*.

I received my Ph.D. from the European University Institute in 2022 and master's degrees from the Hertie School of Governance and Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. During my Ph.D. I was a visiting Fulbright researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
